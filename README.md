##Early-Warning Model for Large-Scale Power-Outages in Michigan 
### Master's Thesis - Code and Pipelines

This repository contains the code and data pipelines used in my master's thesis, which develops a 48-hour early-warning model for weather-driven large-scale outages (more than 50,000 customers) in Michigan. The project uses entirely open-source EAGLE-I outage records, METAR airport data, U.S. Census population density, and GIS layers. 

1. Project Structure

- feature/ outage and meteorological data preprocessing; feature engineering(lags, rolling statistics, IDW)
- 
- Two-Stage Model
    - Stage-1 - Logistic Regression Classifier (anomaly outage in 48h == class 1)
    - Stage-2 - LSTM Regression (defines outage magnitude)
 
- One-Step LSMT (Baseline) for comparison
- Evaluation with  MSE, RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² standard metrics and Conditional MASE (conditional_mase) on high peaks
a Two-Stage LSTM (classification-regression) and a One-Step LSTM baseline. 
- Interactive Visualizations of prediction include:
